I am not really sure what the difference between these two things are, but Carrion insists that the mail is not the medium and just the support, except in the case where some aspects of the process (like stamps and stuff) are used, in which case it is indeed an aspect of the medium. When Carrion listed the post office and the post stamps and the clerks, it really struck me that the medium has nothing to do with the message. Because what I would have expected when I heard mail art was art leveraging the themes associated with mail ‚Äî interconnectedness, globalization, and efficiency, within the mail system to convey a story or message. It's a different way of presentation after all. So I believe the difference between support and medium that Carrion is trying to convey is that support can support the message of the piece, whereas medium is only the physicality of the piece. \n \n Additionally, I am still a bit unsure about what the \"big monster\" Carrion refers to. I feel like it might be something along the sentiment of \"sticking it to the man\", or simply the rebellious attitude people may have been exploring new things away from the norm."

I agree with its claim that many website conventions just follow big tech companies who are profit-driven and do not have the best interest of website builders and viewers at heart. I like the series of metaphors Schwulst uses to describe the broad applications of websites, especially as a thrown rock that's now falling into the ocean, as that is a legitimate view to view website building that many people don't think about. The talking sparrows also impressed me because is they really utilize the juxtaposition between the tech and nature, that really hits a sweet spot in my brain. \n \n Creative Independent is about thinking non-linearly. I found the part where √âdouard U. explains that he reads multiple books at a time, all continuously, admirable, but I don't think I would be able to handle it myself. There is a joke about the younger generations in that we have lower attention spans and can't focus on single things at a time, and I think reading in this fashion would exacerbate that. I do find it valuable connect disperate ideas, because that is one of the best ways to find new ideas, so I agree with the premise of this passage."

One observation he made that I think is still true is that print work has shifted more to collectible/valuable markets, for more special occasions. I also find it interesting how he described a possible future where networked printers share print work similar to how digital work is shared on the internet. I don't think this really caught on as people don't really fax anymore. \n\n Some highlights from the appendix I thought were interesting include: fire damage in print is file corruption in digital. There is an interesting juxtaposition between the abruptness and visibility of fire compared to the much more hidden and insidious ways digital work is lost slowly through time. Also I liked readership versus unique viewers. Unique viewers sound infinitely more corporate or profit-focused but unique does have to be there because views may come from the same people. \n\nAlso I liked that the afterward ended with \"if print is indeed liberating, then start by sharing this book\", which has a sense of irony given we have been shared snippets of this book digitally."

Geocities is really the centerpiece of the amateur web, and it is inspiring to see communities pop up here that feel more organic and less corporate, compared to when people started moving to big social media platforms to share their stuff. The author helped with the archival effort of Geocities, and mentioned that Yahoo shutting down the service was both a blessing and curse because a lot of content was lost, but, a lot was also archived, freezing them as snapshots of the early web. These websites that remain belongs to their time, with the example given to differentiate being that their jpegs were not just rez, but physically smaller than the images we see on web today because of the unique storage limitations."

We first get introduced to Conceptualism as a movement, which is described as a movement blending art with other fields, mostly philosophy, and how that may cause pieces to require more context to be seen as art. Price writes about how modern pieces, taken out of a museum, could be reasonably interpreted as non-art, and so their context is what makes them art, especially considering the philosophical connection conceptualism relies on. He compares this to the internet as another method of dispersal, and examples how the spread of certain non-art material, like the propaganda of the \"Daniel Pearl Video\", is spread organically and artistically, without control by government or corporation, between people and between conversations. I also find interesting his comparison of art to science due to its reliance on journals and conferences, centralized places where context is given to pieces to be dispersed to the general populace."

I agree with their points that organizations might listen to their artists more than their own access workers and so agree that artists themselves can make a big impact by packaging alt text with their other metadata in order to create a more accessible enviornment that people can equitably access. I feel small actions can easily bring the concept of alt-text into the conversation for a very large number of people, for example, I believe Visual Studio Code auto-populates img tags with src=\"\" and alt=\"\", which makes it much more likely for programmers to add alt text when making a site because it is already typed for you. I also appreciate how descriptions of images can contribute and be just as part of the viewing process as the image itself, through poetic licence. It is important to also note that subjectivity isn't a bad thing necessarily when describing alt-text because objectivity is very amorphous, and you do want to convey the purpose of the image on the site."

Graphic design focuses on the communication of signs using surfaces like text or color or pixels. In the modern style, the focus was on clarity of message, a so-called crystal goblet, but what postmodernism brings is more of a focus on the system of messaging itself, of what a sign is. Hypermodernism brings signifiers, being past art, into public consciousness by having them be signifiers themselves. The examine Duvall gives is that of Mickey Mouse, who was originally created to represent a just a mouse for the purpose of a cartoon, but has gained meaning to the public over its lifespan, such as being a symbol of resistance in Nazi Germany. The simplicity of these icons, produced when clarity was the main focus, and their strong geometric shapes, lead them easy to be remixed and questioned under hypermodernism."

With the digital age, there are ways to broadcast media that are not simply discrete posts. Soulellis brings up twitch streams, which is a phenomenon only possible in the digital age, where the content is more diluted, but value is gained simply because it has a lot of eyes on it at once. There is a certain kind of hive mind when watching a live broadcast in that sense. Publishing is no longer just in discrete packages, but as he said, like layers providing a smooth flow of information and data out into the world. It is also less manual, as work can be delegated to bots to change and alter, and even create publications."

The Way is really prominent in computer use because of how the Internet has become centralized with just a few key players. That sometimes leads to narratives that don't tell the full story.
